This project creates a library that can be used to replace the original malloc
and gives equivalent performance for files that are not too large. The malloc
uses a free list pointner that saves the list of free block helping optimize
search of further blocks. The list is at first placed globally and updated
everytime when free() is called and when malloc is causes a split in the 
blocks.
My malloc cannot handle opening real functions like chromium or gimp.
